<h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p>REPSITORY OF JEWELS followed in his visionary father’s footsteps and expanded the ‘REPOSITORY OF JEWELS’ name to a global level. His father Varghese Alukkas started his first jewellery showroom in 1956 and since then Joy Alukkas has made ‘Joyalukkas’ a household name in jewellery. Joy Alukkas took his first step by setting up the jewellery showroom in UAE in the year 1987, since then there has been no looking back.

Joy Alukkas’s success is the result of his forethought. In 1987, when he flew to UAE to explore the untapped market, little did he realise that he was going to change the way the world looked at jewellery. He set up his first shop in Abu Dhabi followed by Dubai, Sharjah, Al Ain and Ras al-Khaimah. The expansion since then has continued to rope in countries like India, UK, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia & Singapore.

Despite running a multi dollar retail gold and diamond jewellery business halfway across the world, Joy Alukkas wears his success lightly. He has his ear to the ground, his finger on the pulse and his feet on the ground. The fact is Joy Alukkas got to where he is because he never compromised with its corporate values and strongly believed that satisfied customers are the backbone of a company.

Joy Alukkas became the first jeweller in the Middle East to be awarded both the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification and to be recognised by the Dubai government with the Dubai Quality Award under Trade category in 2008. The Joyalukkas group has received a long list of awards under his leadership.

It was due to his vision that Joyalukkas CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) efforts were given shape through unique business models. Such an effort is the first of its kind by any jewellery retail chain. For someone who has rarely – if ever – based his decisions on the more modern management tools such as graphs, scales and projections, Joy Alukkas’s meteoric rise is a role model of entrepreneurial grit and intuitive enterprise.

Joy Alukkas revolutionised retail jewellery trade in India by introducing training programs for his employees and also created the concept of “wedding centre” within the jewellery store. Many a feather is attached to the success hat of Joy Alukkas, including the opening of the world’s largest showroom and the first Diamond Cave in Chennai, India, considered the jewellery hub of India. The phenomenal success of this showroom and this unique concept has proved his foresight and business acumen. Today Joy Alukkas leads the various business interests of the Group which includes, Jewellery, Money Exchange, Malls, Fashion & Silks & Luxury Air Charter. </p>
